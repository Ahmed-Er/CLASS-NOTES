1) Write a java program to identify max occured names in given list.

Ramu
Raju
Sita
Ramu
Raju
Gita
Ramu
Raju

If multiple names having same count, print the name which occurs last in alphabitical order.

Ramu-3 times
Raju-3 times

Ouput : Ramu 


2) Write  a java program to read a string and character from keyboard. Then replace character position in string with character occurance.


Input : Deloitte
character : t
output : Deloi12e

Input 1 : OPENTEXT
Input 2 : T
Output : OPEN1EX2


3) Write a java program to read a string from keyboard and replace first half of the string with second half.

Note: If String length is odd number, keep middle character as it is and replace first half with second half.

Input :   sweethouse
Output :  housesweet

Input :   programming
Output :  mmingaprogr



4) Write a java program to read below 2 inputs

   i) read values for integer array : 
		10,2,5,8,-1,3,4

  ii) read one number
		7

Write logic to identify number pairs in array which will give sum as input number(i.e 7).

2+5 = 7  === 2,5
8-1 = 7  === 8,-1
3+4 = 7  === 3,4


5) Write a java program to read values for integer array.

Write logic to identify min and max elements from array.

input : 10,5,6,8,2

output : Min=2  Max=10


6)Write a java program to read below array values.

array  = {1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0}

Write logic to re arrange array elements as zeros should come first and 1 should come last

output : {0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1}



7) Write a java program to read two strings from keyboard and check those 2 strings are anagrams or not.

inputs :  keep  peek

input:    Mother in law  Hitler woman

Input :   Debit Card & Bad Credit

Input :   Silent Cat  & Listen Act

Input:    jar   & raj

8) Write a java program to reverse a string without using predefined reverse() method.
