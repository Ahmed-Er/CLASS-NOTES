SVN Server : One computer -- Visual SVN Server
SVN Client : all team memebers  -- Tortoise SVN / Subclipse

------------------------------------------------------------------

Checkout : Taking project from Repository server to local machine

Add : When we create new files, first we need to add them to commit.

Commit : Pushing files/code from local machine to Repository server is called Commit / Check-in.

Diff : When we are commiting changes to existing repository file then it is highly recommended to see diff first before commiting.

Update : Taking latest changes from Repostiroy file to local file.

Show Logs : Checking history of file commits.


Color Representations
---------------------

Blue color plus : When we add a file to SVN Repo  (File added but not committed Yet. File/Folder is ready to commit).

Red color circle : Changes made to local file those changes are not available in Repository. That color represents we have to commit our local changes.


Green color Tick mark : Repostiroy files and local files are up to date.

Light Yellow Triangle : It represents file is in conflict state.
When conflict happend, junk code will added to our files.
We have to resolve conflicts before committing repository.














Delete : Delete is used to delete one file/folder from repository.

It is two step process

1) Delete file from local machine

2) Commit that change.




Bugfixing for UAT

Triage call : 

out of 5 --- 1 defect is invalid

4 defects are handed over to offshore.


Hi Team,

As per triage call, uat team handed over below 4 defects to us.

Please find below assignments for 21-03-2019.

Bharth -- BUG-109,Bug-108
Raju   BUG-110
Sunil  Bug-111
Rajesh  Bug-112

Note: We have build & deployment at 5:00 PM so plese make sure your checkins are completed before 4:45 PM. SVN will be locked by 4:46 pm.

Thanks & Regards,
Ashok.



Delete : If we want to delete a file from repository server we wil use delete option.

Lock : If we don't want other to commit the file then we will lock tht file. After completion of our commit then we have to release the lock.

Branches in SVN
---------------

trunk
branches
tags





Agile methodology (SDLC)
------------------------

Sprint Planning : One meeting will be conducted to decide scope of Sprint. (10 requirments).


Scrum : Daily standup meeting. (daily for 15-20 mins)

Sprint : Release

Retrospective : Review meeting to analyze what went well and what went wrong in last sprint and analyze lessons learned.


-> Sprint means release to client.

-> Every Sprint will have a number like R.7.0 , R.7.1, R.7.2 etc

-> Every Sprint will have some duration like 2 weeks.



Backlog


Technical Debt - some part is completed.

8 & 9 to next sprint as a backlog from current sprint







Development stage

QA stage

Production 


30 requirements client


R5.1  :  1 - 10 reqirements ( 2 weeks duration) - 1 team

R5.2 :   11-20 requirements ( 2 weeks duration) - 2 team

R5.3 :   21-30 requirements ( 4 weeks duration ) - 3 team

M&O : 10 members

There should be 3 code bases for all three sprints


Hi Team,

As all of you know that, from today we starting R5.1, R5.2 and R5.3 developments paralelly.

PFB code base mappings for the same.

R5.1 - https://192.168.0.1:8080/svn/SBI_Repo/trunk : apr-6

R5.2 - https://192.168.0.1:8080/svn/SBI_Repo/branches/R5.2 : apr-10

R5.3 - https://192.168.0.1:8080/svn/SBI_Repo/branches/R5.3 : apr-20

m & O - https://192.168.0.1:8080/svn/SBI_Repo/tags


Inorder to work with SVN from IDE we need to install Subclipse plugin in IDE.

Subclipse is a open source plugin.

====================================================================

Dis-Advantages
---------------

1) It is centralized

2) Internet Connection is required to access SVN Server

3) Single Point of failure


To Overcome these challenges in SVN, GIT came into Picture.


1) GIT (Client)

2) GIT HUB (Cloud platform)


Distributed System

git hub web application
GIT UI app
GIT Bash (command prompt)




local system ------ local repo  ------- central repo


local repo will be created in our system only

central repo will be created in git cloud


when we create one account in git hub, it provides some free space for us.

Using this free space we can create several repositories.


In GIT central we can create below 2 types of repositories

1) Public Repository : Everybody can see and we can choose who can commit



2) Private Repository : we can choose who can see and commit



GIT Central Repo URL : 

https://github.com/Java-Project-03-9AM/JavaProject_Demo.git

GIT Bash
========
It works as GIT Client

git config : to setup uname and email

git init : to initialize git repo in local system

git clone : checkout

syntax: git clone  <repo-url>




git add : this is used to add a file to staging area


syntax: git add <file-name> (to add specific file)

	git add --a (to add all files)


git commit : to commit changes to local repository

	syntax : git commit -m 'commit message'

git push : to move changes from local repo to central repo

git pull : taking changes from central to local repo

git status : checking staged and un-staged files

git diff : to compare local file with centraol repo file

git checkout : 





https://github.com/Java-Project-03-9AM/JavaProject_Demo.git


src/main/java/com/ashok/properties/AppProperties.java

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")







git config --global  user.email ""

git config --global user.name ""

git init

git clone   <repo_url>

git clone https://github.com/Java/JavaProject_Demo.git

git status

staged files will display in green color
un-staged files will display in red color

git add filename

git add --a (all modified files will get staged)


git commit  -m  'commit msg'  (local repo)

git push







@GetMapping(value="/test")
	public String m3(){
		return "Test";
	}

Hi Build Team,

As part of Asynchronus calls POC, today we have created a new Branch for IES application. Please create pipeline for the same.

Branch Name : async-poc
Project Name: IES

Repo URL : http://www.bitbucket.com/IES.git
